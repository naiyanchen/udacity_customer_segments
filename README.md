# Customer Segmentation Project

This repository contains my attempt to work through the customer segmentation project as part of the **Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree**.

# Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). 

# Workflow

1. Data exploration including the use of decision tree, random forest and linear regressors to explore the relationships between features
2. Data transformation using log/Box-Cox transformations followed by standard scaling
3. Outliers detection 
4. Dimensional reduction using PCA
5. Clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models 
6. Cluster performance evaluation using Silhouette scores and distances between GMMs based on Jensen-Shannon metric
